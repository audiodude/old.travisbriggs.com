          <h2>Music I've Made</h2>
          <p>
            I&apos;ve been writing songs since I was 12 years old (hasn't
            everyone?) but I&apos;ve really gotten serious about it in the past
            three or four years.

          <p>
            My "band" is called
            <a href="https://dangerthirdrail.com">Danger Third Rail</a>. Band is
            in quotes because it's more of a recording project, where I write
            all the songs and play all the instruments. If you like anything you
            hear on this site and <i>do</i> want to start a band or let me join
            yours, please reach out!
          </p>
          <p>
            As of September 2019 I have recorded a single (<i
              >Pink Fluffy Cloud</i
            >) and a 5 song EP (<i>Radio Machine</i>) as
            <a href="https://dangerthirdrail.com">Danger Third Rail</a>. The
            songs are available on iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, etc. But you should
            really click the link to find out more.

            As of 2018, I started running out of space on my Soundcloud account.
            Again. Yes, that's right, I was already paying for a so-called
            &quot;Pro&quot; account, and they apparently wouldn't let me upload
            any more and wanted me to upgrade to a &quot;Pro Unlimited&quot;
            account.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, I downloaded everything off Soundcloud using their API, and
            built a custom static site generator (called
            <a href="https://github.com/audiodude/rainfall">Rainfall</a>, which
            I open-sourced) to serve it. That site is at
            <a href="https://songs.travisbriggs.com">songs.travisbriggs.com</a>
            and you should visit it if you want to hear my latest music.
          </p>
          <p>
            Otherwise, you can still

          <h2>Blogging and me</h2>
          <p>
            Blogging, like editing Wikipedia, is something I always wish I did
            more of. Over the years, my blogging practice has lapsed more than
            it has thrived. As of February 2019, I have relaunched my blog at:
          </p>

          <p><a href="https://write.as/audiodude">write.as/audiodude</a></p>

          <p>Previously, in September 2014, I launched a Medium blog at:</p>

          <p>
            <a href="http://blog.travisbriggs.com">blog.travisbriggs.com</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            That was back before Medium got all <i>monetized</i> and you could
            still add a custom domain for free. I've got legacy access on that
            one.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am always ambivalent between the excitement of publicly sharing my
            ideas with the world, and the fact that it makes me extremely
            vulnerable to people looking me up online. I discuss this more

              a bunch of creative writings
            </a>
            I've done over the years. The website is opressively minimalist and
            the dates are the publication dates, not necessarily when I original
            wrote the works.

            I&apos;ve put together a small collection of 3D and 2D artworks I've
            created over the years. Some of them have accompanying music.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 3D art is done primarily in
            <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>, a 3D Javascript
            creation tool that leverages the HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; element and
            <a

              WebGL</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 2D artworks are older and done in
            <a href="http://processingjs.org/">Processing.js</a> which is a
            Javascript port of the Java Processing framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            In case it's not clear, the source code for all of the animations is
            available on the their respective pages, and is freely available for
            anyone to use.

            I have started a project to catalog all of the best albums in the

            playlists or shuffle!) when enjoying music.

          </p>
          <p>
            The idea is to encompass
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">
              Conway's Game of Life</a
            >
            in each bit of the 24 bit RGB color space. The text on the site sort
            of explains it, but basically, you only need a grid of 1 bit to play
            a game of life:
          </p>
          <pre class="rgb-pre">
0 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0</pre
          >
          <p>
            Where the "1" values are alive and the "0" values are dead. However,
            colors in CSS (the styling system of the web) are specified using 24
            bits. So you can play 24 simutaneous "games of life", one for each
            bit of the RGB color space.
          </p>

          <p>
            The higher order bits contribute more to the overall color
            components of a square, with the left-most bits contributing half
            the value. So, starting with completely random colors, the grid
            seems to settle into shades of Cyan, Yellow and Magenta (close to
            R/G/B).
          </p>

          <p>
            Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the awesome
            contribution of my co-worker
            <a href="https://github.com/funrollloops">Sagar Mittal</a>. He
            really took the idea and ran with it, expanding it to the full
            screen, using HTML 5 canvas, and generally making it fast and
            awesome.

          <p>
            Travis Briggs earned his BS in computer science from
            <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a>.
            He is a software developer, amateur musician, and blogger. All of
            these skills come together on his personal website, located at
            <a href="https://travisbriggs.com">travisbriggs.com</a>
            (this website!)
          </p>

          <p>
            Travis&apos; professional specialties center around open source web
            application development and all of the modern tools that enable this
            task: &quot;scripting&quot; languages such as Ruby, Javascript,
            Python and &mdash; to a lesser extent &mdash; PHP; data stores such
            as MySQL, MongoDB and Cassandra; servers such as nginx and Apache;
            and various other client and server side technologies.
          </p>

          <p>
            At WPI, Travis earned a minor in Music and was the President and
            Music Director of the all-male a cappella group
            <a href="http://shmacapella.com/">Simple Harmonic Motion</a>. He was
            also music director &mdash; and performed improvised music for
            &mdash; WPI's comedy improvisation group
            <a href="http://users.wpi.edu/~improv/">Guerilla Improv</a>.
            Previously, Travis has written and recorded his own music, and has
            performed at open mic nights and as a busker in Cambridge, MA USA.
            He is now living in San Francisco, CA USA.
